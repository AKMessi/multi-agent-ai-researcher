## Key Conclusion
 **Formal Theory: Hyperbolic Anchor-Manifold Flow (HAMF) Theory**

**Statement:**
The HAMF framework posits that long-context semantic representation is optimally achieved by modeling information as a continuous flow within a hyperbolic latent manifold, where the manifold's topological stability is maintained by a discrete skeletal structure of high-salience landmark anchors. This hybrid architecture enables O(1) context navigation by mapping hierarchical semantic relationships into the exponential volume of hyperbolic space while utilizing discrete re-anchoring to bound the numerical drift inherent in continuous-time state transitions.

**Axioms:**
  A1. Semantic Hierarchy Axiom: Natural language and complex information structures possess an underlying hierarchical topology that is most efficiently embedded in hyperbolic geometry rather than Euclidean space.
  A2. Integration Drift Axiom: Any continuous latent state update mechanism (e.g., Neural ODEs or SSMs) accumulates numerical er
