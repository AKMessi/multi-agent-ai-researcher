## Key Conclusion
 **Formal Theory: The Theory of Homeostatic Morphogenetic Intelligence (HMI)**

**Statement:**
Intelligence is an emergent property of a self-organizing neural fabric that minimizes Variational Free Energy (VFE) through the dynamic, metabolically-constrained reconfiguration of its topological phenotype (Active Node Substrate) governed by a high-dimensional genetic registry (Morphogenetic Seed Registry).

**Axioms:**
  A1. Structural Plasticity Axiom: Neural topology is a dynamic inference-time variable rather than a static training-time constraint.
  A2. Thermodynamic Constraint Axiom: The instantiation and maintenance of neural nodes incur a metabolic cost proportional to local information density and hardware resource consumption.
  A3. Homeostatic Stability Axiom: Structural transitions are gated by a temporal hysteresis function (N-timesteps) to prevent topological oscillation in high-noise environments.
  A4. Decentralized Signaling Axiom: Global coordination is achieved via low-f
